<body> I`m really interested at technology and computer. I want to create my own website and games for us.
    I chose BSIT because I have always been interested in technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems.  <p>
        Growing up, I enjoyed exploring computers, mobile apps, and learning about new digital trends, which inspired me to pursue a 
            course that would allow me to develop my skills in this field. BSIT offers a great opportunity to learn about programming, networking, and system development,
             which are all essential in todays digital world.
             Another reason why I chose BSIT is because I see the huge demand for IT professionals not just in the Philippines but all over the world. Technology is constantly evolving,
              and almost every industry today relies on computers and digital systems to operate efficiently. <br>
              <br>By taking this course, I can equip myself with the knowledge and skills needed
               to keep up with these advancements and become more competitive in the job market. <br>
               I also believe that BSIT will allow me to improve my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills
                because it involves analyzing systems and creating effective solutions.     
                <br> In addition, I am passionate about innovation and I want to be part of a community that develops new software
                 and applications that can help businesses and people in their daily lives. This course will give me a strong foundation and the right training to achieve those goals and to build a
                  successful and fulfilling career in the future.
